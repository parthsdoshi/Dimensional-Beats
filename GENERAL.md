**what is being worked on right now before we move on to anything else**
* Basically, to attack the main character will use his/her abilities to play music. The user can swap in and out “abilities” or music pieces he/she learns. As the ability is being played, time stops/slows down around the user so they can hit the notes of the ability. How many notes they hit defines just how effective the ability is.

### Other Mechanics
* Music Puzzles
* Bosses
* Music CrossFade/Effects/Remixes
* Making sure music never gets boring and is intuitive to learn
* Chaining music combos
